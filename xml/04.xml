        <description desCat="criticism">I shall now make a fiew observations or reflections on the Buisness of
        this day. Had the Enemey for once forsaken theire long established
        mode of fighting (Viz) that of extending theire lines so as to gaine the
        flanks of theire advasary&#8212;for by this means they so weakened themselves
        in all points as not to be able to make but a feable resistance in
        any one, much less beat &amp; confuse the lines of theire opposers, which in
        this case they might have easily done, had they kept themselves compact
        and advanced with Judgement. (I say had the Enemey been formed in
        tolerable close orders and advanced in the first instance, close on the heals
        of our retireing Spies &amp; Advanced guard, I am Satisfied they would
        have made a Breach in any part of our Columns as our Front was so extended
        as to render the whole in any one part, unequal to the resistants
        of a well formed body rapidly advancing on them, besides our orders or
        mode of Formation required very considerable time to performe the perparitory
        Evolutions: on the other hand, had the Kentucky Volunters
        (who composed half of our forces) been so disposed of as to have
        gained the reare of the Enemy soon after they commenced the attack,
        Then I am Satisfied we should had the pleasure of seeing every Head of
        this dreaded Hydra at our feet; but from theire Situation or (as some
        say for the want of orders) they were so far from gaining this grand
        position, that not more then 300 out of 1500 well mounted Riflemen were
        ever brought to action, and they but a fiew moments. Cannot but be
        astonished when the world informed that the <person pID="01"><pTitle stTitle="Commander in Chief">Comdr in Chief</pTitle></person> had been
        told on the day previous to the action, by an officere of Rank an credebillity
        (<person pID="34"><pRank stRank="Major">Majr</pRank> <pSurname>Price</pSurname></person> of the Volunteers who commd a sort of Independant
        partizan-corps and had been sent for the Express purpose) that the
        Enemey were laying in wait for us &amp; formed in Such a possition" &amp; also
        gave His Excellency an exact Discription of the ground I say, the
        whole world cannot but be surprised that the <person pID="01"><pTitle stTitle="Commander in Chief">Comdr in Chief</pTitle></person> did not
        availe himself of this advantage &amp; by throwing the Voluntiers in the
        reare of the Enemey &amp; eventually cut off theire retreat: but so far was
        his Excelcy from thus putting an end to this expensive war (I believe
        that the atack of the Enemey at the time it happined was actually a matter
        of Surprise to almost every officer in the army</description>&#8212;<action actCat="burial" who="US Army">The Bodies of Capt.
