                <description desCat="criticism">I shall now make a fiew observations or reflections on the Buisness of
                    this day. Had the Enemey for once forsaken theire long established
                    mode of fighting (Viz) that of extending theire lines so as to gaine the
                    flanks of theire advasary&#8212;for by this means they so weakened themselves
                    in all points as not to be able to make but a feable resistance in
                    any one, much less beat &amp; confuse the lines of theire opposers, which in
                    this case they might have easily done, had they kept themselves compact
                    and advanced with Judgement. (I say had the Enemey been formed in
                    tolerable close orders and advanced in the first instance, close on the heals
                    of our retireing Spies &amp; Advanced guard, I am Satisfied they would
                    have made a Breach in any part of our Columns as our Front was so extended
                    as to render the whole in any one part, unequal to the resistants
                    of a well formed body rapidly advancing on them, besides our orders or
                    mode of Formation required very considerable time to performe the perparitory
                    Evolutions: on the other hand, had the Kentucky Volunters
                    (who composed half of our forces) been so disposed of as to have
                    gained the reare of the Enemy soon after they commenced the attack,
                    Then I am Satisfied we should had the pleasure of seeing every Head of
                    this dreaded Hydra at our feet; but from theire Situation or (as some
                    say for the want of orders) they were so far from gaining this grand
                    position, that not more then 300 out of 1500 well mounted Riflemen were
                    ever brought to action, and they but a fiew moments. Cannot but be
                    astonished when the world informed that the <person pID="01"><pTitle stTitle="Commander in Chief">Comdr in Chief</pTitle></person> had been
                    told on the day previous to the action, by an officere of Rank an credebillity
                    (<person pID="34"><pRank stRank="Major">Majr</pRank> <pSurname>Price</pSurname></person> of the Volunteers who commd a sort of Independant
                    partizan-corps and had been sent for the Express purpose) that the
                    Enemey were laying in wait for us &amp; formed in Such a possition" &amp; also
                    gave His Excellency an exact Discription of the ground I say, the
                    whole world cannot but be surprised that the <person pID="01"><pTitle stTitle="Commander in Chief">Comdr in Chief</pTitle></person> did not
                    availe himself of this advantage &amp; by throwing the Voluntiers in the

                    his Excelcy from thus putting an end to this expensive war (I believe
                    that the atack of the Enemey at the time it happined was actually a matter
                    of Surprise to almost every officer in the army</description>&#8212;<action actCat="burial" who="US Army">The Bodies of Capt.
