         <p>This website examines the historical documentation surrounding the Battle of Fallen Timbers, a small conflict with a large effect on North American history. The battle took place on 20 August 1794 between the newly trained US Legion with a supplement of Kentucky Militia, and a mixed confederacy of Great Lakes region Native Americans and their Canadian and French allies. It took place on the banks of the Maumee River in what is now northwest Ohio, only a few miles from a British fort, built and occupied despite its prohibition in the Treaty of Paris.</p>

         <p>Several personal journals and formal reports exist from that day on the Maumee. Each speaks about the battle and its aftermath from a different perspective. To recreate the history of the battle, historians must examine all the sources and compare and contrast them to uncover the most accurate narrative.</p>

         <p>The American accounts contain very little on their Native American enemy, and political infighting within the Army alters certain authors' accounts. General Wayne, in writing to his superiors in Washington, attempts to write a full and balanced, yet complimentary, account of his victory. The British discuss the Native Americans and make a point to comment on the destruction the US Army has caused and the region's uncertain future. Unfortunately, no direct Native American account exists to tell the story of the most powerful Native American alliance in North American history.</p>

         <p>Select one of the battle accounts on the left to read a document. Select the Summary tab on the top right to see a comparison of each document and the widely varying descriptions of the battle and its aftermath.</p>
