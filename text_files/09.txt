Camp, Near Fort Miamis, 27th Aug 1794.

Dear Sir:

It was not possible for me sooner to communicate the events which have lately
happened in this Country--General Wayne with an Army of Near 4000 men
(according to the report of deserters) made gradual approaches towards us until
his arrival at Roche de Bout on the 17th Inst.--where he fixed his head Quarters,
on the 18th--the Spy May was taken, who informed the Indians it was intended
to attack them the Next day,--unless the General should determine to build a
Fort, in which case he would not advance until the day following, on the 19th the
Indians to the number of 1300 marched Early to the most advantageous Ground,
but a strong detachment of Cavalry only made their appearance and retired as
Soon as the Indians showed themselves.

On the 20th the American Army advanced and were first attacked by the left
of the center of the Indian line which extended near three quarters of a mile
obliquely upward,--the Americans Soon gave way & a rapid pursuit took place
for about a mile where the Indian discovered the whole of the American Army
Posted to whom they gave Battle retiring slowly before them, during this period,
the Wyandot and Ottawas who were on the Right were Warmly Engaged by the
American left consisting of both Cavalry and infantry who out flanked and infiladed
the Indians until they retreated--the whole line of the Indians then retired below
the Fort imagining their loss to be much greater then it since appears to have been
having seen several of their Principal Chiefs fall;--The greatest cost they have
sustained is in their leaders they halted that night at Swan Creek about six miles
below and were not pursued, there were never more than 400 Indians engaged during
the whole day and these stood the shock of a great part of their Army for upwards
of two hours and lost in the whole but 19 men among whom are to be much lamented
8 Principal Chiefs of the Wyondots and two of the Ottawas, besides two more
wounded--

By the reports of several deserters and from a survey of the field of Action
(for they did not even bury but few of their dead) it appears the Americans lost
between 3 and 400 Killed and Wounded and a great many horses.--The opperations
of the Garrison I must leave to be detailed by those whose duty it is, but I must
observe to you that all the store houses, my own House with many things that
could not be removed were burnt by a Party of General Wayne's Army within
sight of the Garrison. I hope soon to have the pleasure of seeing you.--At present
I am waiting until the Indians whose Cornfields and Villages are totally destroyed
Shall determine where they and their Families will set themselves down it being a
matter of the highest importance to the Interest of Great Britain to prevent if
possible their emigrating to the Southern and western parts of the Continent,
they Seemingly now having lost all hopes of the Interference of Government.--

Some letters passed between Major Campbell Commanding Fort Miamis
& General Wayne after the Action, and on the 22nd the American Army quited
the position they had taken within a mile of the Fort, and retreated the very same
way they came, but whether on account of the want of Provisions, or of an order
from Philadelphia cannot be Certainly known.--The American Army have left
Evident marks of their boasted Humanity behind them besides scalping and mutilating
the Indians who were killed in Action, they have opened the Peaceful Graves
in different parts of the Country, Exposed the Bones of the consumed & consuming
bodies, and horrid to relate have with unparalleled barbarity driven stakes
through them and left them objects calling for more than human Vengeance.

I am with great Regard & Esteem, Dear Sir
Yours Very Sincerely

A. McKee
