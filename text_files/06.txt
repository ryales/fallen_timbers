August 20th 1794--marched this morning about 7 O'Clk
instead of the hour prescribed--the troops divested of every
species of baggage except their blankets--the strength of the
right Column was precisely 368 non commissioned-officers
and privates--say of the 3 S Legn 250 and of the 1st S L. 118.
the C in C ordered that the files should be doubled, and an
interval of at least 200 yards from the centre column to be
observed--Capt Springer who led the right flank Rifle Men
was ordered to observe an equal distance from the Column--the
old Man has forgot the Columns of Cavalry and light
Infantry which must be between the main right Column and the
Riflemen--the regulation gives the right wing a front of 800
yards--this however is a pardonable--but his total deviation
from the promise made yesterday to Genl W. to alter his disposition
of march, is in every view unpardonable--now if we
had an enemy of military sagacity to contend with, he might
with facility turn either our right or left flank, neither of which
I am well assured have been examined more than two or three
miles, and when we reach the extent of our march fall suddenly
upon our baggage and provision, and by destroying them not
only defeat the expedition but actually destroy the army, as we
take but two days provision with us--the face of the Country
as we leave our encampment is agreable--the day hot and
clear--the river bubbling over a Rocky sheet is bordered by a
luxuriant prairie from 1/4 of a mile to 600 yards wide--then
we have a regular swell rising to the height of 80 or 100 feet
covered with timber of various denominations which is sparse
on the brow of this height, runing almost paralel with the
River but inclining to the left--the surface is flat--the wood
thickens--becomes swampy and in some places almost impervious
from the underwood and small growth--it may be
necessary to add that the high ground before spoken of which
flanks the river in a direction nearly paralel,--is cut by many
deep, steep and short ravines, runing nearly at right angles to
the general course of this height--

having advanced about 4 miles I rode to the brow of this
height with Genl W. who wanted to examine the position of his
flank column and to get a view of McKees house on the East
side of the river, and of the British Post with the flag flying
below--Genl W made report of this to the C in C in the centre
whose aid de Camp Capt De B and Mr E. the Contractor
returned with him to take a view of the fort--when we reached
the brow of the height, our attention was called by Dr Heyward
to some horsemen who were pushing rapidly across the
prairie about 1/4 of a mile in our front--it was first supposed
they were a part of the volunteers in quest of plunder but observing
them to alter their direction for our front and hearing
at the same moment a few shot--Genl W rode up to Capt
De B and requested him to hasten to the C in C and apprize
him that our advance was attacked and retreating--he had
scarcly made this observation when 40 or 50 of the mounted
volunteers were discovered to be retreating directly toward us,
in great confusion and before a faint fire of the enemy--the
moment was critical as the troops had not yet received orders
to form--Genl W. hailed and halted the retreating party--reminded
them of their name fame & Country and exhorted
them to turn and oppose the Enemy who were runing forward
and throwing their shot at random and were by this within
150 yards--several agreed to try and fight--but the Generals
presence being necessarily called to the command of his wing--the
moment his back was turned they broke and resumed their
flight thro the 1st Sub Legion then forming--

the Genl having brought up Gaines' Light Infantry and
formed them in advance to check the enemy, repaired immediately
to his left which was pressed by the Enemy--they were
almost formed, tho in order, much too close--this defect
was soon remedied and the troops stood with shouldered arms--when
we reached the extreme left of the 3d S Legn we found
Capt Miss Campbell, retreating with his troop in good Order--and
also that Capt H Lewis who commanded the advanced
light Infantry & Rifle Men had fallen back and was mixed
with the left of the right wing--we were at this time under a
scattered fire of the Enemy at 100 yards distance--Genl W
enquired of Capt Miss Campbell "what was the matter in front"
he answered "every thing is confusion" and asked the Genl
what he should do, who observed to him, that he not being
under his command he could give him no orders, but recommended
to him to fall back & form squadron in his rear--the
Genl then pushed towards the right, when we gained the right
of the 3d S. L. then commanded by Cap Kingsbury,100 found
he Enemy within 80 yards, Mr Gaines in the interim having
changed his position by order from some person unknown and
firing as warmly as the smallness of their number would permit--Kingsbury
applied to the General for permission to
charge but he having no orders or authority for that purpose
forbid him & commanded him to stand his ground—he then107
ordered a Serjeant of Dragoons (neither of aids being near to
him) to ride to Capt Springer & inform him it was his desire
that he should push forward and flank the Enemy on their
left--returning to the centre Kingsbury again asked leave to
charge, which was refused, as no order had been received or
signal heard to that effect--at this instant Miss Campbell
ordered the charge and dashing forward, passed the 1st Battn
of the 3d S L. before the Genl could speak to him; in making
this charge he was obliged to cross a steep ravine in our rear
and to ascend a narrow point across which the troops of the
right were formed--the ground in front was open and smooth
and the Enemy at 80 or 100 yards distance--Genl W seeing
the peril to which this movement exposed Miss Campbell,
instantly (and without orders) directed a general charge--but
being immediately informed that the height and strength of the
grass in the prairie prevented the Riflemen from getting forward
he sent his A D. C. Capt Shaumburgh to Capt Springer
with directions to bring him into action on the high ground--and
as the light Infantry under Gaines were similarly circumstanced,
he presumed tho without authority to give similar
orders to him--he also ventured to form Lieut. Webb with the
first troop in his rear, with orders to follow the line at 150 yards
distance--

the charge succeeded as directed, the enemy making little
or no resistance, but fell back from ravine to ravine loading &
firing at a considerable distance as we advanced--the fire was
truly so light and the resistance so feeble, that we began to apprehend
a deception and that the enemy had sent forward light
parties to harrass and disorder us, and to draw us in that Condition
into the hands of their main body--under this impression
Genl W rode to the C in C whom he found in the centre and
suggested to him his apprehensions and the propriety of halting
and forming--he told him, to do so--but the intention was
defeated by an increased fire from the enemy on the left--the
charge was therefore renewed after a momentary and partial
halt which had not given time to form the line--during the
pause the Genl sent his extra aid de Camp, Lieut C. Smith109
with a message to the C in C--he sought but could not find him
and returning received a shot in his right breast which by the
faculty is deemed to be mortal--this affair had lasted nearly an
hour--the artillery were left behind, the light Infantry and
Rifle Men could not get up into the action and the troops were
much disordered--the charge still continued & the fire of the
enemy began to slacken--At this moment Lieut Covington110
of the Dragoons was observed in our front charging from the
left to our right with 6 or 8 Dragoons, and the ground being
even and the wood open, having gained our right near the brow
of the height he wheeled to the left and was charging to the
front, the enemy being then in view and retreating--Genl W
sent his A. D. C. Mr Shamburgh to order Lieut Webb to
charge--and called to Covington to halt, but as his voice could
not reach him and seeing him rushing upon destruction--(as
he would with 6 or 8 men have been in with the Enemy long
before Webb could get up) in order to save him, he determined
to make a decisive tho not very justifiable attempt--he clapped
spurs to his horse & runing at full speed about 250 yards in
front of his line and close upon the rear of the Enemy, passed
and halted Covington for a moment--this gave time for Webb
to shew himself and support--in making this movement the
Genl had thrown himself between Covington and a Savage
who presented his piece at him but did not fire, altho' he passed
within a few paces of him--Covington seeing his danger,
charged this son of the woods, sword in hand and killed him
on the spot--the Genl having accomplished his purpose which
was to save or to give a fair chance to a gallant officer and an
amiable man, wheeled and rejoined his command which was
still advancing—mean time Covington & Webb kept up the
charge and we saw no more of the Enemy--Covington killed
two and Webb one Indian with their own hands--the retreat
soon after beat, when we halted and formed in one line--

in the commencement of the action Capt Shamburgh
(whom the Genl had left at the head of his Column to receive
orders for him while he road to the right) having heard a
firing in front, rode to the centre and apprised the C in C of our
being attacked--who replyed, "Yes, I heard it, there was 6 or
8 Guns"--the other rejoined in surprise "6 or 8 Sir! I have
heard at least 150 shot" and turned off in disgust--at this
instant the Militia were discovered to be flying in front--some
person near the C in C then observed that they were
runing and asked what was to be done after a short pause--the
C. in C. bawled out "prepare to receive the Enemy in front in
two Lines"--but his voice could not be heard 150 yards at
which distance each Column was from the centre and this was
the only order we received from him prior to or during the
action--Col. H informs also, that he received no order during
the action, or for forming--Genl W formed in one line--he in
two--consequently the 2d S L. scarcely got into the action and
the 4th S L was at one period nearly out flanked--the light
Infantry & Dragoons who were selected and reserved for the C
in C's special command, acted I am well assured, without orders
from him--notwithstanding the wise precaution which have
been taken by frittering up the army, into guards & Detachments,
we were fairly surprised, & the Enemy within Gun-Shot
of us before we were formed--it is unquestionable with me,
that if the Enemy had struck with their whole force at any
point of our army--instead of attempting with 900 men to
form a line of two miles they would have penetrated and if they
pleased passed thro us, making great havock at least--all the
pompous and prolix orders of battle, heretofore issued and received,
were here entirely neglected, not a word was uttered
about forming the square--the light Infantry, Rifle Men &
Cavalry attacked immediately--fell back to the Columns and
were not fixed upon total extirpation--neither of these Corps
were embodied and they were in general left to exercise their
own discretion--yet when I saw the C in C he appeared tranquil--no
attempt was made to profit by our victory--altho'
very few of the volunteers had been engaged--and a great
proportion of our Dragoons were in vigorous plight--instead
of letting loose 1700 men upon the disordered rear of the
dismayed fugitives, we made a dead halt the moment the fire
of the enemy ceased and they were not pursued one single step,
except by the Dragoons under Covington and Webb--the
Command of whom Genl W. had assumed--this looks more
like unto a drawn battle than a victory--if Miss Campbell
charged by order, he was sacrificed--if of his own accord he
threw away his life--his loss is to be regretted as he was a
good officer--

this affair which does not deserve the name of a Battle
began at 10 O Clk and the troops halted at 5 minutes after 11
O'Clk--we remained on the ground untill 4 O'Clk--no order
was given by the C in C to collect and bury the dead or to
recover the axes and mens blanketts, which had been dropt in
the begining of the fight--Individuals sought for their
wounded friends--and Genl W. without order, made a small
detachment for this purpose--these when collected were
ordered back to deposit Camp under the Escort of a Body of
volunteers and the army moved forward at O'Clk to
encamp on the Bank of the Miami in sight of and about one
mile distant from the British fort--several of the wounded
who were left with the volunteers, were brought back into
Camp after dark, & about 8 O'Clk this evening Genl Todd
brought in a wounded man who had been found on the field by
the militia--the C in C seems disposed to confer the honor
of the day upon the left Wing or rather 4th Sub Legion--a
small number only of the volunteers got into the action on the
left and behaved well--a partial and impolitic issue of whiskey
was made after the affair was over, of which the volunteers
were excluded from partaking--the C in C this evening swore
that "he had seen in front of the 4th S Legn at one view, 400
Savages as naked by by the eternal God! as they came out
of their mothers Wombs"--a french man, painted and dressed,
as a Savage, was found after the affair terminated, conceal near
the river bank armed with a double barrelled fusee--he is
recognised by Col. Hamtramck as a former resident of Ouittanon--he
says he is a trader--that he arrived at the British
Fort, the evening before--that his boat had been taken to bring
up provision from Cedar Island and that he had been forced
to go into the Battle tho' he had not fired his gun--which from
examination appeared to be true--he informs that the Body
opposed to us consisted of 900 Indians about 40 White men--	that
the Indians were averse to the action but that Elliot &
McKee who were engaged in person dragged them into it
telling them, they need but make a trial of what they could
do--he says the Women & children had been removed a considerable
distance below the fort and that he expects the Indians
will draw off and wait the issue of an attack upon that place--he
adds that messages had been sent to all the nations to
assemble--that the Chippiways had refused to come and he
did not know what might be the determination of the other
Nations--he further says that an express had been sent to
Niagara for a reinforcement to the Garrison--that [t]he whole
force of the British Garrison is 250 and that 50 of these are
sick--It is worthy of remark here that this evening after the
army halted, the C in C got into a violent passion with Capt
Ford, whose men warm with fatigue & nearly exhausted had
pulled off their Coats--in the course of his ravings, he addressed
himself to a drummer who happened to be present and
said--"I have fought under the hotest and the coldest suns
and such a thing never was permitted nor shall it now be done--it
is damned cowardly"--

Without disparagement to any person the Individual act of
greatest Gallantry this day exhibited on the right, was performed
by Lieut. Shamburgh A D C to Brg Genl Wilkinson--this
officer being sent by his Genl with an order to the light
troops of the right flank--and perceiving as he led on part of
the light Infantry under Ensign Claiborne, a party of savages
firing from a Covert of Bushes and high grass on the Margin
of the Prairie--he, sword in hand dashed into the thickett,
gained the rear of an Indian warrior and the pursuit actually
actually forced him upon the bayonets of Claiborne's
party--

It is also a tribute due to Mr R Elliot the Contractor to
declare--that he so far participated in the action, as to lead two
companies of the Kentucky volunteers, who were lost and
flying, up to the fire of the enemy--an office which few
men in his Station would have undertaken.
