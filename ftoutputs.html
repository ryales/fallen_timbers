            <h3><i>Forces</i></h3>
            <ul>
               <li>As to
                  the number of the enemy engaged in this action, opinions are
                  so various that I am at a loss to know what to say; the most
                  general opinion is one thousand five hundred, one-third of
                  which are supposed to be Canadians; I am led to believe this
                  number is not over the mark
               </li>
               <li>they opposed
                  us with about 900 Indians &amp; 150 Canadians
               </li>
               <li>From every account the enemy amounted
                  to two thousand combatants: the troops actually
                  engaged against them were short of nine-hundred.
               </li>
               <li>there were never more than 400 Indians engaged during
                  the whole day and these stood the shock of a great part of their Army for upwards
                  of two hours

               <li>whilst I pay this just tribute
                  to the living, I must not forget the gallant
                  dead: among whom we have to lament the
                  early death of those worthy &amp; brave Officers
                  Capt. Miss Campbell of the Dragoons and
                  Lieut. Towles of the light Infantry of the
                  Legion who fell in the first charge.

               <li>Enclosed is a particular return of
                  the killed &amp; wounded—the loss of the Enemy
                  was more than double, that of the Federal
                  Army
               </li>
               <li>the woods were strewed for a considerable
                  distance with the dead bodies of
                  Indians &amp; their white auxiliaries, the
                  latter, armed with British muskets and
                  bayonets
               </li>
               <li>several of their Principal Chiefs fall;—The greatest cost they have
                  sustained is in their leaders
               </li>
               <li>lost in the whole but 19 men among whom are to be much lamented
                  8 Principal Chiefs of the Wyondots and two of the Ottawas, besides two more
                  wounded
               </li>
               <li>it appears the Americans lost
                  between 3 and 400 Killed and Wounded and a great many horses

            <ul>
               <li>all the
                  houses &amp; corn fields were consumed &amp; destroyed
                  for a considerable distance both above and
                  below Fort Miamis, as well as within pistol
                  shot of that Garrison, who were compelled
                  to remain tacit spectators of this general devestation
                  &amp; conflagration.—among which were the
                  houses, stores &amp; property of Colo. McKee the British
                  Indian Agent &amp; principal stimulator of the
                  war now existing between the United States
                  and the savages.

                  on each side of the Miamis: there remains
                  yet a number of villages &amp; a great quantity
                  of corn to be consumed or destroyed upon
                  Au Glaize &amp; the Miamis above this place,
                  which will be effected in the course of a
                  few days

               <li>all the store houses, my own House with many things that
                  could not be removed were burnt by a Party of General Wayne's Army
               </li>
               <li>The American Army have left
                  Evident marks of their boasted Humanity behind them besides scalping and mutilating
                  the Indians who were killed in Action, they have opened the Peaceful Graves
                  in different parts of the Country, Exposed the Bones of the consumed &amp; consuming
                  bodies, and horrid to relate have with unparalleled barbarity driven stakes
                  through them and left them objects calling for more than human Vengeance.

            <h3><i>Landscape</i></h3>
            <ul>
               <li>On front &amp; between the indians was a large quantity of
                  falling down Timber, which was a shelter for the indians, where they remained some
                  time
               </li>
               <li>found the way extremely bad, much embarrassed by the thickness of
                  the woods on the left and by a number of Steep Reviens on the Right
               </li>
               <li>the Ground for 5 miles high
                  &amp; dry open Woods tall large Oaks
               </li>
               <li>a lo swampy ground with a great dale of
                  fallen Timber and thick brush with Hoop and black Ash bushes which
                  rendred the place difficult to see a Man 10 yds
               </li>
               <li>in sight of the
                  army was the River divided by a large Island well Cultivated with
                  Corn &amp; beans and a number of Stacks of Hay which was a pleaseing
                  sight to the Army but more particularly to the Volunteers that was
                  across the River and bringing loads of Corn and Hay in one hour
                  after the army got to the ground
               </li>
               <li>a close thick wood
                  which extended for miles on our left; and
                  for very considerable distance in front, the
                  ground being cover'd with old fallen timber
                  probably occasioned by a tornado, which
                  rendered it impracticable for the Cavalry
                  to act with effect, &amp; afforded the enemy the
                  most favorable covert for their savage mode
                  of warfare
