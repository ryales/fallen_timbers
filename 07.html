               Head Quarters
               Grand Glaize 28th Augt. 1794.
               
            </h3>
            <p>
               Sir,
               
            </p>
            <p>
               It's with infinite pleasure that
               I now announce to you the brilliant success
               of the Federal Army under my command in
               a general Action with the combined force of the
               hostile Indians &amp; a considerable number of
               the Voluntiers &amp; Militia of Detroit on the
               20th. instant on the banks of the Miamis, in
               the vicinity of the British Post &amp; Garrison
               at the foot of the rapids.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               The army advanced from this
               place on the 15th instant and arrived at
               Roche de bout on the 18th.; the 19th. we were
               employed in making a temporary post for
               the reception of our stores &amp; baggage &amp; in
               reconnoitering the position of the enemy, who
               were encamped behind a thick brushy-wood
               and the British Fort.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               At 8. o'clock on the morning of the
               20. the Army again advanced in columns
               agreeably to the standing order of march:
               the Legion on the right Flank covered by
               the Miamis, one Brigade of mounted Voluntiers
               on the left under Brigadier General
               Todd, and the other in the rear under Brigadr
               General Barbee: a select battalion of mounted
               voluntiers moved in front of the Legion, commanded
               by Major Price, who was directed
               to keep sufficiently advanced—so as to give
               timely notice for the troops in case of action.;
               
            </p>
            <p>
               It being yet undetermined whether the
               Indians wou'd decide on peace or war.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               After advancing about five miles, Major Price's
               corps received so severe a fire from the enemy, who
               were secreted in the woods &amp; high grass, as to
               compel them to retreat.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               The Legion was immediately formed
               in two lines, principally in a close thick wood
               which extended for miles on our left; and
               for very considerable distance in front, the
               ground being cover'd with old fallen timber
               probably occasioned by a tornado, which
               rendered it impracticable for the Cavalry
               to act with effect, &amp; afforded the enemy the
               most favorable covert for their savage mode
               of warfare: they were formed in three lines
               within supporting distance of each other, &amp;
               extending near two miles at right angles
               with the river.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               I soon discovered from the weight
               of the fire, &amp; extent of their lines that the
               enemy were in full force in front in possession
               of their favorite ground &amp; endeavoring to turn
               our left flank, I therefore gave orders,
               for the second line to advance to support
               the first, &amp; directed Major General Scott to
               gain &amp; turn the right flank of the savages,
               with the whole of the mounted Voluntiers
               by a circuitous route: at the same time I ordered
               the front line to advance &amp; charge with trailed
               arms, &amp; rouse the Indians from their
               coverts at the point of the bayonet, &amp; when up,
               to deliver a close — well directed fire on their
               backs followed by a brisk charge—so as not
               to give time to load again:—I also ordered
               Capt Mis Campbell who commanded the Legionary
               Cavalry to turn the left flank of the enemy
               next the river, and which afforded a favorable
               field for that corps to act in.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               All those orders were obeyed with
               spirit &amp; promptitude—but such was the impetuosity
               of the charge by the first line of
               Infantry, that the Indians &amp; Canadian
               militia &amp; voluntiers were drove from all their
               coverts in so short a time, that although
               every possible exertion was used by the Officers of
               the second line of the Legion, &amp; by Generals
               Scott, Todd &amp; Barbee of the mounted voluntiers
               to gain their proper positions, but
               part of each could get up in season to participate
               in the action; the enemy being drove
               in the course of one hour more than two
               miles thro' the thick woods already mentioned,
               by less than one half their numbers.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               From every account the enemy amounted
               to two thousand combatants: the troops actually
               engaged against them were short of nine-hundred.—this
               horde of savages with their
               allies abandoned themselves to flight, and
               dispersed with terror &amp; dismay; leaving our
               victorious Army in full &amp; quiet possession of
               the field of battle, which terminated under
               the influence of the guns of the British Garrison
               as you will observe by the enclosed correspondence
               between Major Campbell the Commandant
               &amp; myself upon the occasion.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               The bravery &amp; conduct of every
               Officer belonging to the Army from the Generals
               down to the Ensigns merits my highest
               approbation.—there were however some, whose
               rank &amp; situation placed their conduct in a
               very conspicuous point of view, and which I
               observed with pleasure &amp; the most lively
               gratitude: among whom I must beg leave
               to mention Brigr. Genl. Wilkinson and Colo.
               Hamtramck, the commandants of the right
               &amp; left wings of the Legion, whose brave example
               inspired the troops; to them I must add the
               names of my faithful &amp; gallant Aids de Camp
               Captain's De Butts &amp; T. Lewis &amp; Lieut. Harrison
               who, with the Adjt. General Major Mills rendered
               the most essential services by communicating
               my orders in every direction, &amp; by their
               conduct &amp; bravery, exciting the troops to
               press for victory.—Lieut. Covington upon
               whom the Command of the Cavalry now
               devolved, cut down two savages with his
               own hand &amp; Lieut. Webb one, in turning
               the enemy's left flank.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               The wounds received by Capts.
               Slough &amp; Prior &amp; Lieut Campbell Smith
               (an extra aid de Camp to Genl Wilkinson) of
               the Legionary Infantry, &amp; Capt. Van Ransselaer
               of the Dragoons, &amp; Capt. Rawlins,
               Lieut McKenney &amp; Ensign Duncan of the
               mounted Voluntiers bear honorable
               testimony of their bravery &amp; conduct.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Captains H. Lewis &amp; Brock with their
               companies of light Infantry had to sustain
               an unequal fire for some time, which they
               supported with fortitude.—In fact every
               officer &amp; soldier who had an opportunity to
               come into Action displayed that true bravery
               which will always insure success.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               And here permit me to declare,
               that I never discovered more true spirit
               and anxiety for action than appeared to pervade
               the whole of the mounted voluntiers; &amp; I am
               well persuaded that had the enemy mantained
               their favorite ground but for one half hour
               longer, they would have most severely felt
               the prowess of that corps.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               but, whilst I pay this just tribute
               to the living, I must not forget the gallant
               dead: among whom we have to lament the
               early death of those worthy &amp; brave Officers
               Capt. Miss Campbell of the Dragoons and
               Lieut. Towles of the light Infantry of the
               Legion who fell in the first charge.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Enclosed is a particular return of
               the killed &amp; wounded—the loss of the Enemy
               was more than double, that of the Federal
               Army—the woods were strewed for a considerable
               distance with the dead bodies of
               Indians &amp; their white auxiliaries, the
               latter, armed with British muskets and
               bayonets.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               We remained three days &amp; nights
               on the banks of the Miamis in front of the
               field of battle, during which time all the
               houses &amp; corn fields were consumed &amp; destroyed
               for a considerable distance both above and
               below Fort Miamis, as well as within pistol
               shot of that Garrison, who were compelled
               to remain tacit spectators of this general devestation
               &amp; conflagration.—among which were the
               houses, stores &amp; property of Colo. McKee the British
               Indian Agent &amp; principal stimulator of the
               war now existing between the United States
               and the savages.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               The Army returned to this place
               on the 27. by easy marches, laying waste the
               villages &amp; cornfields for about fifty miles
               on each side of the Miamis: there remains
               yet a number of villages &amp; a great quantity
               of corn to be consumed or destroyed upon
               Au Glaize &amp; the Miamis above this place,
               which will be effected in the course of a
               few days.—in the interim we shall improve
               Fort Defiance, &amp; as soon as the escort returns
               with the necessary supplies from Greeneville
               &amp; Fort Recovery, the Army will proceed to
               the Miami villages in order to accomplish
               the object of the Campaign.—
               
            </p>
            <p>
               It is however not improbable
               that the enemy may make one more desperate
               effort against the Army; as it is said that a
               reenforcement was hourly expected at Fort
               Miamis from Niagara, as well as numerous
               tribes of Indians living on the margins
               &amp; Islands of the Lakes: this is a business
               rather to be wished for than dreaded, whilst
               the Army remains in force—their numbers
               will only tend to confuse the savages, and the
               victory will be the more complete and
               decisive,—and which may eventually ensure
               a permanent &amp; happy peace.

            <p>
               Under these Impressions, I have
               the honor to be
               
               your most obedt.

               NB. I had forgot to mention that I met my
               Flag on the 16., who was returning with an
               evasive answer in order to gain time
               for the arrival of the reenforcement mentioned
               by the Shawanoe Indians, &amp; which actually
               did arrive two days before the action.

               to deliver a close — well directed fire on their
               backs followed by a brisk charge—so as not
               to give time to load again
            </p>
            <p><i>Right Dragoons (battle): </i>I also ordered
               Capt Mis Campbell who commanded the Legionary
               Cavalry to turn the left flank of the enemy
               next the river, and which afforded a favorable
               field for that corps to act in.
            </p>
            <p><i> (battle): </i>such was the impetuosity
               of the charge by the first line of
               Infantry, that the Indians &amp; Canadian
               militia &amp; voluntiers were drove from all their
               coverts in so short a time, that although
               every possible exertion was used by the Officers of
               the second line of the Legion, &amp; by Generals
               Scott, Todd &amp; Barbee of the mounted voluntiers
               to gain their proper positions, but
               part of each could get up in season to participate
               in the action
            </p>
            <p><i>Native Confederacy (retreat): </i>the enemy being drove
               in the course of one hour more than two
               miles thro' the thick woods already mentioned,
               by less than one half their numbers
            </p>
            <p><i>Native Confederacy (retreat): </i>this
               horde of savages with their
               allies abandoned themselves to flight, and
               dispersed with terror &amp; dismay; leaving our
               victorious Army in full &amp; quiet possession of
               the field of battle
            </p>
            <p><i> (diplomacy): </i>terminated under
               the influence of the guns of the British Garrison
               as you will observe by the enclosed correspondence
               between Major Campbell the Commandant
               &amp; myself upon the occasion
            </p>
            <p><i> (commendation): </i>I must beg leave

               Captain's De Butts &amp; T. Lewis &amp; Lieut. Harrison

               the most essential services by communicating
               my orders in every direction, &amp; by their
               conduct &amp; bravery, exciting the troops to
               press for victory
            </p>
            <p><i> (battle): </i>Lieut. Covington upon

               testimony of their bravery &amp; conduct.
            </p>
            <p><i> (commendation): </i>Captains H. Lewis &amp; Brock with their
               companies of light Infantry had to sustain
               an unequal fire for some time, which they
               supported with fortitude.
            </p>
            <p><i>US Officers (casualty): </i>whilst I pay this just tribute
               to the living, I must not forget the gallant
               dead: among whom we have to lament the
               early death of those worthy &amp; brave Officers
               Capt. Miss Campbell of the Dragoons and
               Lieut. Towles of the light Infantry of the
               Legion who fell in the first charge.
            </p>
            <p><i> (casualty): </i>Enclosed is a particular return of
               the killed &amp; wounded—the loss of the Enemy
               was more than double, that of the Federal
               Army
            </p>
            <p><i>Native Confederacy (casualty): </i>the woods were strewed for a considerable
               distance with the dead bodies of
               Indians &amp; their white auxiliaries, the
               latter, armed with British muskets and
               bayonets
            </p>
            <p><i>US Army (destruction): </i>all the
               houses &amp; corn fields were consumed &amp; destroyed
               for a considerable distance both above and
               below Fort Miamis, as well as within pistol
               shot of that Garrison, who were compelled
               to remain tacit spectators of this general devestation
               &amp; conflagration.—among which were the
               houses, stores &amp; property of Colo. McKee the British
               Indian Agent &amp; principal stimulator of the
               war now existing between the United States

               villages &amp; cornfields for about fifty miles
               on each side of the Miamis: there remains

               of corn to be consumed or destroyed upon
               Au Glaize &amp; the Miamis above this place,
               which will be effected in the course of a
               few days
            </p>
            <p><i>US Army (plan): </i>the Army will proceed to
               the Miami villages in order to accomplish
               the object of the Campaign
            </p>
            <p><i> (diplomacy): </i>NB. I had forgot to mention that I met my
               Flag on the 16., who was returning with an
               evasive answer in order to gain time
               for the arrival of the reenforcement mentioned
               by the Shawanoe Indians, &amp; which actually
               did arrive two days before the action.
