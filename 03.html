               Camp in sight of a British garrison, on the Miamis of the Lake,
               August 20th, 1794—one hundred and fifty miles from Greenville.
               
            </h3>
            <p>
               This day the legion, after depositing every kind of baggage,
               took up the line of march at 7 o'clock, and continued their
               route down the margin of the river, without making any
               discovery, until 11 o'clock, when the front guard, which was
               composed of mounted volunteers, were fired on by the enemy.
               The guard retreated in the utmost confusion through the front
               guard of the regulars, commanded by Captain Cook and
               Lieutenant Steele, who, in spite of their utmost exertion,
               made a retreat. These fell in with the left of Captain
               Howell Lewis' company of light infantry and threw that part
               of the men into confusion, which Captain Lewis observing, he
               ordered the left of his company to retreat about forty yards,
               where he formed them and joined the right, which had stood
               their ground. They continued in this position until they
               were joined by part of Captain Springer's battalion of riflemen,
               which was nearly fifteen minutes after the firing commenced,
               who drove the enemy that had attempted to flank us on the
               right. Nearly at the same time, the right column came up,
               and the charge was sounded—the enemy gave way and fired
               scattering shots as they run off.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               About the time the right column came up, a heavy firing
               took place on the left, which lasted but a short time, the
               enemy giving way in all quarters, which left us in possession
               of their dead to the number of forty. Our loss was thirty
               killed and one hundred wounded. Among the former we have to lament the loss of Captain
               Miss Campbell of the
               dragoons, and Lieutenant Henry B. Fowles of the 4th sub-legion;
               and of the latter, Captains Prior of the first, Slough
               of the fourth, and Van Rensselaer of the dragoons, also
               Lieutenant Campbell Smith of the fourth sub-legion. The
               whole loss of the enemy cannot at present be ascertained, but
               it is more than probable it must have been considerable, for
               we pursued them with rapidity for nearly two miles. As to
               the number of the enemy engaged in this action, opinions are
               so various that I am at a loss to know what to say; the most
               general opinion is one thousand five hundred, one-third of
               which are supposed to be Canadians; I am led to believe this
               number is not over the mark. After the troops had taken
               some refreshment, the legion continued their route down the
               river, and encamped in sight of the British garrison. One
               Canadian fell into our hands, who we loaded with irons.
