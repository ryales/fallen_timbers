        This day the legion, after depositing every kind of baggage,
        took up the line of march at 7 o'clock, and continued their
        route down the margin of the river, without making any
        discovery, until 11 o'clock, when the front guard, which was
        composed of mounted volunteers, were fired on by the enemy.
        The guard retreated in the utmost confusion through the front
        guard of the regulars, commanded by Captain Cook and
        Lieutenant Steele, who, in spite of their utmost exertion,
        made a retreat. These fell in with the left of Captain
        Howell Lewis' company of light infantry and threw that part
        of the men into confusion, which Captain Lewis observing, he
        ordered the left of his company to retreat about forty yards,
        where he formed them and joined the right, which had stood
        their ground. They continued in this position until they
        were joined by part of Captain Springer's battalion of riflemen,
        which was nearly fifteen minutes after the firing commenced,
        who drove the enemy that had attempted to flank us on the
        right. Nearly at the same time, the right column came up,
        and the charge was sounded&#8212;the enemy gave way and fired
        scattering shots as they run off.

        About the time the right column came up, a heavy firing
        took place on the left, which lasted but a short time, the
        enemy giving way in all quarters, which left us in possession
        of their dead to the number of forty. Our loss was thirty
        killed and one hundred wounded. Among the former we
        have to lament the loss of Captain Miss Campbell of the
        dragoons, and Lieutenant Henry B. Fowles of the 4th sub-legion;
        and of the latter, Captains Prior of the first, Slough
        of the fourth, and Van Rensselaer of the dragoons, also
        Lieutenant Campbell Smith of the fourth sub-legion. The
        whole loss of the enemy cannot at present be ascertained, but
        it is more than probable it must have been considerable, for
        we pursued them with rapidity for nearly two miles. As to
        the number of the enemy engaged in this action, opinions are
        so various that I am at a loss to know what to say; the most
        general opinion is one thousand five hundred, one-third of
        which are supposed to be Canadians; I am led to believe this
        number is not over the mark. After the troops had taken
        some refreshment, the legion continued their route down the
        river, and encamped in sight of the British garrison. One
        Canadian fell into our hands, who we loaded with irons.
