        A sower of Rain prevented our move at the
        houre appointed, but we took up the Line of March at 7 o'Clock and
        found the way extremely bad, much embarrassed by the thickness of
        the woods on the left and by a number of Steep Reviens on the Right,
        after proceeding about 2 hours our Spies &amp; advance guard Discovered
        the Enemy and received their fire, but with inconsiderable Loss were
        driven back and joined the main Body of the Army, by this time the
        Right division, Comded by Genl. Wilkinson felt the effects of the Enemeys
        fire, they was immediately formed &amp; returned the fire, at this period
        Capt. Campbell troop made a charge in which he fell &amp; his Troop immediately
        proceeded through surported by the Infantry's charge which
        oblidged the enemey to quit theire position and look for more advantagous
        ground. on our Left &amp; they made an exertion to gaine that Flank
        but Colo Hamtramck who commanded in that Quarter was perpared &amp;
        gave them so warm a recption as made theire Situation here as disagreeable
        as that on the Right, and the charge both on the Right &amp; left both
        became Genl. &amp; the Enemy was repulsed with precipation; The charge
        of the Cavelry closed the seene in front &amp; drove the Enemey 3/4 of a
        mile at the same instant, The Riflemen &amp; Light Infantry, receved a
        most heavy fire, on the extreem left flank, The Entrepid Lieut. Towls
        fell at this fire, We drove the Enemy for about one mile directly out,
        with the Loss of Lieut. Towls &amp; a fiew Infantry on our Side, in this
        quater was Killed 3 white men &amp; several Indians mostly by the Riflemen.
        the Troops were now refreshed with 1/2 a gill of Whiskey which
        they much required as the action continued more then an houre, the
        greater part of which time they were in full Speed pressing the Enemey&#8212;after
        remaining on this ground a fiew hours Dureing which time the
        wounded were Brought in Dressed &amp;c we proceeded within about one
        mile of the British Garrison and there took up our Encampment.

        I shall now make a fiew observations or reflections on the Buisness of
        this day. Had the Enemey for once forsaken theire long established
        mode of fighting (Viz) that of extending theire lines so as to gaine the
        flanks of theire advasary&#8212;for by this means they so weakened themselves
        in all points as not to be able to make but a feable resistance in
        any one, much less beat &amp; confuse the lines of theire opposers, which in
        this case they might have easily done, had they kept themselves compact
        and advanced with Judgement. (I say had the Enemey been formed in
        tolerable close orders and advanced in the first instance, close on the heals
        of our retireing Spies &amp; Advanced guard, I am Satisfied they would
        have made a Breach in any part of our Columns as our Front was so extended
        as to render the whole in any one part, unequal to the resistants
        of a well formed body rapidly advancing on them, besides our orders or
        mode of Formation required very considerable time to performe the perparitory
        Evolutions: on the other hand, had the Kentucky Volunters
        (who composed half of our forces) been so disposed of as to have
        gained the reare of the Enemy soon after they commenced the attack,
        Then I am Satisfied we should had the pleasure of seeing every Head of
        this dreaded Hydra at our feet; but from theire Situation or (as some
        say for the want of orders) they were so far from gaining this grand
        position, that not more then 300 out of 1500 well mounted Riflemen were
        ever brought to action, and they but a fiew moments. Cannot but be
        astonished when the world informed that the Comdr in Chief had been
        told on the day previous to the action, by an officere of Rank an credebillity
        (Majr Price of the Volunteers who commd a sort of Independant
        partizan-corps and had been sent for the Express purpose) that the
        Enemey were laying in wait for us &amp; formed in Such a possition" &amp; also
        gave His Excellency an exact Discription of the ground I say, the
        whole world cannot but be surprised that the Comdr in Chief did not
        availe himself of this advantage &amp; by throwing the Voluntiers in the
        reare of the Enemey &amp; eventually cut off theire retreat: but so far was
        his Excelcy from thus putting an end to this expensive war (I believe
        that the atack of the Enemey at the time it happined was actually a matter
        of Surprise to almost every officer in the army&#8212;The Bodies of Capt.
        Campbell &amp; Lieutenant Towles (the only officers killed) were entered
        immediately after the action. The whole ammount of the Killed on our
        part were 240 the loss of the Enemey not precisely ascertained but not
        more than 30 or 40 were found Dead, and a fiew Canadians one was
        taken prisoner, who was a treader amoung the Indians, and says they opposed
        us with about 900 Indians &amp; 150 Canadians.
